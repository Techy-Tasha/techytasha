                    <p>Today I worked on creating my development environment; this includes setting up my Terminal and learning basic shell (bash) commands.</p><br>
                    <p>Command Reference</p>
                    <ul class=>
                        <li>pwd - print working directory</li>
                        <li>ls - list everything inside the current directory</li>
                        <li>ls -l - lists directory vertically, and alphabetically, also shows permissions, date and file creator, and more.</li>
                        <li>cd ~ - takes me back to the home directory</li>
                        <li>chmod - adjusts permissions</li>
                        <li>mkdir - make a new directory</li>
                        <li>touch - create a new file</li>
                        <li>rm - delete file</li>
                        <li>rm-r  - remove directory and all files</li>
                        <li>mv - move</li>
                        <li>cp - copy</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Learnings and Git Shenanigans</h4>
                    <p>This enabled me to move through directories and navigate the terminal. I also reinforced my wifi and device security in order to prevent being hacked easily. Then I connected my VScode to Github and Microsoft in order to push commits from my local environment to Github.  Allowing me to get those coveted green squares :laughing:.</p><br> 
                    
                    <p>The VScode connection to my Microsoft account allows me to remotely pair with other developers. Lastly, I learned the lingo, ie directory = file. I decided to pack it up for the day and throw the laptop out the window when I discovered I don’t have Git downloaded on my local computer.</p>

                <p>Today started with debugging git error from yesterday.  I did this by checking the logs. Inside the log discovered I need to insert the information below using the following commands:</p><br>
                <p>git config --global user.email "[you@example.com](mailto:you@example.com)"</p><br>
                <p>git config --global [user.name](http://user.name/) "Your Name"</p><br>
                <p>Miraculously this worked!  This was my first foray into deciphering the information to find what is relevant to the problem and then researching and applying the solution.  i.e.: googling the whole error message :sweat: .  So, now I know what debugging is and how to do it :laughing:
                    </p><br>
                <p>Despite my plans for the day, this led to looking into the base differences between Git and Github.  Git is how I manage my code locally and Github is an application that moves the code from my local device, online.   From there I went down the Git rabbit hole, I quickly realized how expansive Github is.  I learned that while I am curious, I am not THAT curious…it works, imma move on.  I ended up renaming my default branch from Master to Main, how I found myself there, I don't know, I started with rabbit hole right?</p>

                <h4>Rabbit Hole Diaries</h4>

                <p>Task: Move files from one directory to another.</p><br>

                <p>Result: …cd, ls, cd, ls, cd, ls….google…this looks good…cp -r…yup, that's it…cd, ls, cd, ls….where are the files?  whelp, I lost the files….time to wrap it up….wait, why are they on my desktop…:boom:</p><br>

                <p>    well, now that I found the files… I quickly exited the terminal and dragged and dropped the files where I need them to be. </p>

                <h4>Back on Track</h4>

                <p>Now, I was finally able to move the files from my local device to Github.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>created the repo in github with .readme</li>
                    <li>cloned repo to local directory (git clone xyz)</li>
                    <li>made changes in local directory </li>
                    <li>pushed changes to Github</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>committed local code to GitHub through the command line. did this by using:</li>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>git init - b main (Initialize the local directory as a Git repository.)</li>
                                    <li>git add . (gets files ready to move)</li>
                                    <li>git commit -m “first commit” (adding files to local git)</li>
                                    <li>git push origin main (pushes files to github)</li>
                                </ol>
                        </ul>
                </ol>

                <p>Whew, what a day…I think I'm going to roll over the rest of the to-do list to tomorrow.</p>
